                <h1 className="font-semibold">10. Arbitration</h1>
                <p>You and we both agree to resolve disputes related to your use of the Services or these Terms <span
                        className="font-semibold"> (each, a
                        “Claim”) </span>in binding arbitration instead of court, except that either party may bring suit
                    in court
                    to enjoin the infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
                    Arbitration Definition. Arbitration does not involve a judge or jury. Instead, a neutral person
                    <span className="font-semibold">(the
                        “arbitrator”) </span> hears each party’s side of the dispute and makes a decision that is
                    finally
                    binding on
                    both parties. The arbitrator can award the same relief as a court could, including monetary damages.
                    While court review of an arbitration award is limited, if a party fails to comply with the
                    arbitrator’s decision, then the other party can have the arbitration decision enforced by a court.
                </p>
                <p>Individual Basis. YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE YOUR CLAIMS WITH US SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS
                    PART OF A CLASSclassName, REPRESENTATIVE OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION. WE AGREE TO DO THE SAME, WHETHER OR NOT YOU
                    OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION. ACCORDINGLY, UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE BOTH ARE WAIVING
                    THE RIGHT TO PURSUE OR HAVE A DISPUTE RESOLVED AS A PLAINTIFF OR MEMBER IN ANY CLASSclassName, REPRESENTATIVE
                    OR CONSOLIDATED ACTION.</p>
                <p>The Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted under the American Arbitration Association
                    (“AAA”) Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”). The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or
                    by calling 1-800-778-7879.</p>
                <p>The Arbitration Proceeding. The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA or a comparable arbitration
                    body in the event the AAA is unable to conduct the arbitration. Payment of all filing,
                    administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.</p>
                <p>Unless the arbitrator finds your Claim frivolous, we’ll pay for all filing, administration and
                    arbitrator fees if your Claim is for less than $10,000, and we won’t seek our attorneys’ fees and
                    costs if we prevail in the arbitration. The arbitration may be conducted in writing, remotely (e.g.,
                    by videoconference), in San Francisco, California, United States or at some other location that we
                    both agree to.</p>
                <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding against us, send a letter requesting arbitration and describing
                    your Claim to hey@raiderly.app, 340 S Lemon Ave #2143, Walnut, CA 91789, United States. If we
                    request arbitration against you we will give you notice at the email address you use to grant access
                    to the Services.</p>
                <p>30 Days Right to Opt-Out. If you don’t want to agree to arbitrate your Claims as explained above,
                    then you can opt-out of this arbitration agreement by notifying us of your decision in writing at
                    hey@raiderly.app, and physical notice at 340 S Lemon Ave #2143, Walnut, CA 91789, United States. You
                    must opt-out within 30 days of the date you first agree to these Terms or any updated Terms.</p>

                    otherwise transferred by you without Raiderly’ prior written consent. We may assign these Terms as
                    part of a corporate reorganization, upon a change of control, consolidation, merger, or sale of all
                    or substantially all of its assets related to these Terms or for commercial purposes. Any purported
                    assignment in violation of this section is null and void.</p>
                <p>Waiver. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Use on one occasion will not
                    be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. If any
                    particular provision of these Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable, that part will be
                    modified to reflect the original intention of the parties, and the other parts will remain in full
                    force and effect.</p>
                <p>Governing Law. These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to
                    its conflict of laws provisions.</p>
                <p>Privacy Policy. Our Privacy Policy governs how we collect, use and disclose information from the
                    Services.</p>
                <p>Feedback. We welcome feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the Services
                    (collectively “Feedback”). You acknowledge and expressly agree that any contribution of Feedback
                    does not and will not give or grant you any right, title or interest in the Services or in any such
                    Feedback. All Feedback becomes the sole and exclusive property of Raiderly, and Raiderly may use and
                    disclose Feedback in any manner and for any purpose whatsoever without further notice or
                    compensation to you and without retention by you of any proprietary or other right or claim.</p>
                <p>Beta Features. Product features clearly identified as Beta features made available by Raiderly are
                    provided to you for testing purposes only, and Raiderly does not make any commitment to provide Beta

                    Raiderly may immediately and without notice remove Beta Features for any reason without liability to
                    you. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Terms, all Beta Features are provided "AS IS"
                    without warranty of any kind and without any performance obligations.</p>
                <p>Service Providers. For the avoidance of doubt, Raiderly may engage third parties as service providers
                    to the Services (for example, as of the date of these Terms, Raiderly hosts the Services on Amazon
                    Web Services).</p>
                <p>Force Majeure. Raiderly will not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes
                    or conditions beyond our reasonable control.</p>

                    regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given by Raiderly: (i) via e-mail; or (ii) by
                    posting to the Site. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on
